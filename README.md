Various traces from parts of Google cluster management software and systems.

# Cluster workload traces
These are traces of workloads running on Google compute cells.

  * [ClusterData2011\_2.md](ClusterData2011_2.md) provides data from an 12.5k-machine cell over about a month-long period in May 2011.
  * [TraceVersion1.md](TraceVersion1.md) is a short trace that describes a 7 hour period from one cell (cluster).
  * A [bibliography](bibliography.bib) of related work provides bibtex data for papers about or derived from these traces.

# ETA traces

These are [execution traces from ETA](ETAExplorationTraces.md) (Exploratory
Testing Architecture), which is a testing framework that explores interactions
between distrinbuted, concurrently-executing components.

Let us know about issues or insights by
[sending an email](mailto:googleclusterdata-discuss@googlegroups.com) to the
[discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/googleclusterdata-discuss). (Please
join it to keep up to date!)  The more specific the data, the more likely we are
to be able to help you.

If you have (or generate) tools that help analyze or decode the trace data,
please share them with others.  We'd be happy to host them on this site.  Ditto
for the analyses themselves.
